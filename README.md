Unlike most Metaverse projects, which aim for the entire Metaverse field and virtual reality for gaming, Metaverse MGL states that a network is not just for gaming.
The goal of Genesis is much bigger than building a ground for play; We have created a world for you here so that you can live in it with your own rules without limit in your imagination.
In Genesis land, the game, like other programs, can be run if needed by the owners or residents of the land.
Genesis land  does not intend to become just a gaming platform. That is why Metaverse MGL declares that it has no plans to make its own game or advertise its game on the Genesis land, and this is one of the rules of the creators and designers of Genesis and is registered in the ledger .

Genesis invites game companies that are able to work on the network and have virtual reality capabilities to offer their games to landowners and residents, and if they wish, they can play their games on the Genesis network. Or game developers can own the land themselves and run their game on their own land for their land dwellers. If desired, game development companies can hold their games in the form of online tournaments. There is no restriction for owners and residents to run the game on the network.

Here, by default, we have prepared an economic model for the games, which can change the economic model of the game if the game is run by the game developer or landowners.
Genesis is your land and you can write the rules from scratch.
The play-to-earn game model (MGL-P20) uses the idea of an open economy and rewards any user who adds value by playing and spending time in the game ecosystem. Genesis rewards its customer loyalty and gives each player an equal chance to prove themselves and their skills. Players on the Genesis land can earn money even without joining monetary competitions. This game is different from other play-to-earn games because users can earn money in three different ways:
1. Winning matches: Players form their own team to compete and win money by being in only 75% of the top teams.

2. Network Commission: Players can refer other smartphone users to the Genesis land using a unique code. When their nominees participate in monetary competitions, players receive 1.5% of the cost of their competition.

3. Referral : Users of the Genesis land can also monetize referrals from self-referenced ones. Genesis land rewards its users with up to 10 referral levels on the network.
